Every Morning I come here
looking at the trash cans of every house 
to collect whatever people wasted overnight
I was shocked this morning, but I need to kept calm.
This male single dorm. Lives Eason - 40213.

You see the problem?
-> What do you mean?
-> Of course I do.

Look.
PINK shoes. 
Worn Out.
So he throw it away.
Isn't blue or black good enough for a true man?
Imagine what kind of people he could be if he wears pink.
If no one does anything, would he be wearing PINK on street in the future?
Think about it.

-> I'll think about it.
-> What a shame. Here is 10 sb as a reward for your clue.

Sure, you gotta have to keep the evidence.
Here, take what you want and I'll have the rest.
